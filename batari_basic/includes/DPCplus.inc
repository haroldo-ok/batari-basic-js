; Inclues go below - order is crucial, since this is also the order in which
; they will appear in the generated assembly file

; header file
DPCplusheader.asm


; score graphics - at beginning instead of end
score_graphics.asm

; DPC startup routine
DPCstartup.asm

; DPC+ kernel lives in first bank
DPCplus_kernel.asm

; The overscan routine goes below.  it sets up sprites for the std_kernel.
; if you have any routines that will not run until the overscan period,
; put them immediately below this line.

; do we need an overscan routine?

; below is the generated batari Basic file

bB.asm

; DPC frequencies
DPC_waveforms.asm

; rest of bB stuff, ending with graphics
bB2.asm

; below is the footer, which contains the score digits and startup vectors.
; If you want to create your own custom score digits, you may hack the file below,
; but first you should rename it to something else.

DPC_ORG.asm
banksw.asm
DPCplusfooter.asm
DPC_frequencies.h
