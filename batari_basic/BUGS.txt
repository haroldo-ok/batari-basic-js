  any know workarounds.

_Known_Bugs_

  overview:   DPC+ vsprite vertical stack glitch. 
  details:    If the virtual sprites are stacked with very little
              spacing, cumulative round-off can occur, and eventually coarse
              positioning will happen during a virtual sprite display, 
              resulting in a visual glitch.
  workaround: avoid stacking vsprites vertically without much
              spacing. Or put them all on even or all odd rows, depending 
              if the height of the vsprites are even or odd.
		
  overview:   PAL pfres linecount bug.
  details:    Using "set tv pal" with standard kernel and pfres
              causes incorrect scanline counts for certian pfres values.
              workaround: use a value that provides a correct linecount, or
              use pal60 instead.

  overview:   DPC+ double-line bug
  details:    In higher resolutions in the DPC+ kernel, the top PF line is
              duplicated.
  workaround: None
