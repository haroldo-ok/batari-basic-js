# bb4web

This is an experiment on using [Emscripten] to compile [batari Basic] in order to run it on a web browser.  The source code for [8bitworkshop] was used as a reference.

## Usage

Just serve the root directory with the web server of your choice. It should compile the source code that's included on `index.html`.
